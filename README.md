# Dotfiles Repo

This is where I'm storing my dotfiles. Exciting, right?

This repo is being managed via [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm), so make sure it's [installed](https://yadm.io/docs/install).

Setup dotfiles by cloning this repo with `yadm` (boostrap files are included in this repo and will run automatically after clone):
```
yadm clone --bootstrap https://github.com/tjhop/dotfiles.git
```
